# CruiseControl.rb Plugins

This project provides plugins for
[CruiseControl.rb](http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/).  Install the
plugins into your CruiseControl.rb instance by copying the Ruby files to the
`builder_plugins` subdirectory of the data directory used by CruiseControl.rb.
This will typically be `.cruise/builder_plugins` under the home directory of the
user running CruiseControl.rb.

Instructions for the use of the plugins are provided in the documentation for
each plugin.  After installing the plugins and restarting the CruiseControl.rb
server, visit the server and browse the documentation link provided.  At version
1\.4.0, the URL is something like _http://myserver:3333/documentation/plugins_.
